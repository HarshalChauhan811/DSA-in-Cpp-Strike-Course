## 📌 Course Philosophy

✔ **Concept First** – Understand *why* a data structure or algorithm exists  
✔ **Implementation Focused** – Clean, readable, and optimized C++ code  
✔ **Problem Solving** – Build confidence for interviews & real projects  

> “DSA is not about solving problems fast,  
> it’s about thinking right.”
